# Crystal Collecot Game

Here's how to play:

There are four crystals displayed on the page.

You will see a random number between 19 and 112 at the start of the game.

When you clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to your total score.  

Each crystal has a random number assigned to it at the begining of each game which is hdidden to you until you click a crystal.


You wins if the total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game and lose if you go over the random number.

The game restarts whenever you win or lose.
